## Sonification of Water Levels
Sonification is useful for examining large datasets *quickly* or *easily* (one such example being heart rate monitor beeps). The [Sonification Handbook](https://sonification.de/handbook/download/TheSonificationHandbook-chapter12.pdf) states that the "the best conditioning is no conditioning," in regards to transforming a dataset into sound.

As an exercise, let's represent oscillation-based data as audio! An obvious example of oscillation in nature are ocean waves! I'll be using data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jolasa/waves-measuring-buoys-data-mooloolaba).

See the notebook for more info.
